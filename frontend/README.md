## Introduction

The Spreadsheet App is a web application that allows users to create and manage spreadsheets. It provides a grid-like interface where users can input values, perform calculations using formulas, and save the data to a backend server.

## Features

- Create and manage spreadsheets with custom rows and columns.
- Input values in cells and perform calculations using formulas.
- Save and load spreadsheet data to/from a backend server.
- Search for specific values in the spreadsheet.

## Technologies Used

- React: Frontend library for building user interfaces.
- TypeScript: A superset of JavaScript that provides static typing for better code integrity.
- Math.js: A library for performing mathematical operations and evaluating formulas.
- Axios: A library for making HTTP requests to the backend server.
- Docker: A containerization platform for packaging applications with their dependencies.
- Docker Compose: A tool for defining and running multi-container Docker applications.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js and npm: Make sure you have Node.js and npm installed on your machine.

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Jobsy/engineering-challenge-the-journey
```

2. Change to the project directory:

```bash
cd frontend
```

3. Install dependencies:
```bash
npm install
```

### Running the Application

#### Development Mode

To run the application in development mode with hot-reloading, use the following command:
```bash

- [X] Handle potential performance issues with the server, which is slow and buggy.

### Auto-saving User Input
- [X] Implement auto-saving functionality to save user inputs periodically.
- [X] Utilize the server's ability to save spreadsheet data as a CSV blob.
- [X] Handle server errors and random latencies gracefully in the UI.

### Reactive UI
- [X] Ensure the UI reacts responsively to user interactions and updates.
- [X] Compute spreadsheet formulas on the client side to provide real-time updates.
- [X] Computation of expressions in cells should trigger onblur events.
- [X] Handle expressions that reference cells with changing values and recompute relevant expressions accordingly.

### Spreadsheet Expression Language
- [X] Support a simple expression language where computable expressions must be prefixed with '='.
- [X] Enable basic arithmetic expressions, with optional support for floats.
- [X] Allow value references in expressions using column labels (A to Z) and row numbers (n+).
- [ ] Support multiple-digit row numbers for value references (e.g., A10, A100).

### Technology
- [X] Implement the solution using React.
- [X] Use either JavaScript or TypeScript for the project, based on your preference.
- [X] Ensure code implementation follows best practices and makes good design decisions.

### Server
- [X] Work with the provided server, which is slow, buggy, and designed to test UI performance.
- [X] Handle server errors and random latencies while still aiming for an exceptional user experience.
- [X] Use the server's API to save spreadsheet data in CSV format for auto-saving functionality.

### Additional Notes
- [X] Don't confuse users with missing design elements; add elements to enhance user understanding and experience.
- [X] Feel free to improve the design and functionality as needed to create a seamless spreadsheet application.
- [X] Make good design and code implementation choices to provide an outstanding solution.

- [ ] **Formula Suggestion**: Add formula suggestions or auto-completion to assist users while entering formulas.
- [ ] **Rich Text Editing**: Allow users to enter rich text in cells, including hyperlinks and images.
- [ ] **Formula Previews**: Provide formula previews to show users the result of a formula before applying it.
- [ ] **Optimization**: Optimize the cell rendering and evaluation process for better performance.
- [ ] **Data Persistence**: Add functionality to save and load spreadsheets from a server or local storage.
